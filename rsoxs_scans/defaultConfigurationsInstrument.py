## This file is intended to contain all default and frequently used instrument configurations instead of having them in rsoxs package
## The plan is to have a single dictionary with each key being the name of the configuration, and the values can be dictionaries of motor names, positions, and order to move.
## TODO: see how motor positions from spreadsheet are used to move to sample location, and follow that workflow for configurations
